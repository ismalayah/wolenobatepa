"The Grey Zone" deals with the daily details of the work gangs--who lied to prisoners, led them into gas chambers, killed them, incinerated their bodies, and disposed of the remains. All of the steps in this process are made perfectly clear in a sequence, which begins with one victim accusing his Jewish guard of lying to them all, and ends with the desperate sound of hands banging against the inside of the steel doors.</description></item><item><title>Personal Best movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1982)</title><link>/personal-best-1982.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/personal-best-1982.html</guid><description>It is a movie containing the spontaneity of life.
