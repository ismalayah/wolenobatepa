As reported by <a href=#>ShowNews Today</a>, the "Loba" singer reportedly discovered that her longtime boyfriend, Gerard Piqué, was unfaithful when she found someone dug into her jar of jam. Shakira had been traveling and upon coming home, she became suspicious of the eaten jam because Piqué was not a fan of the sugary spread. There may be truth to this rumor if Shakira's music video for her song <a href=#>"Te Felicito"</a> with Rauw Alejandro is any indication. In one scene, she is seen opening the fridge to find Alejandro's disembodied head on a shelf.</p><p dir=ltr>Months after their split, Piqué was seen with Clara Chia Marti, a 23-year-old who works at his production company. It's unclear when their relationship started, but a source told <a href=#>The Sun</a>, "Gerard and Clara have been seeing each other for months ... They have been keeping quiet about their relationship but those around them all know what is happening." However, according to internet sleuths, their romance may have started a lot earlier than Shakira suspected.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampkaH10f46sn5qjmaeubrPEq5irnF2ltrLBxGaaoZ2Rqbavs4yjmKZn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
