Whether it’s from his starring roles in Central Intelligence, Ride Along, Get Hard, or Jumanji, Hart has become a household name around the world for his acting ability alongside his comedy quips.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>From the beginning of his career, Hart has used his height as a comedic device as one of the shorter people amongst his peers and this has continued through into his film career.

This might not be such as a surprise given the emphasis that Hart puts on this fact within his comedy. However, as a lead male, traditionally actors are much taller. Despite his shortcomings (no pun intended), Hart has heaped praise on his height stating that nothing special comes from being tall and that personality “is the biggest and best thing you could have.”</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>The lack of height hasn’t stopped Hart from propelling himself into stardom with his charismatic personality and impressive acting chops. Hart is the perfect example of embracing who you are, remaining true to yourself, and putting in maximum effort in succeeding within your field.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=false>If you’re wanting to see a Hart’s height on full display, you can catch him <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside goliath The Rock in these cla</a><a href=#>ssic films</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXamurbiMoqpmo5Wrtq95x5qprWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
