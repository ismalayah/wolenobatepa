Will's myriad tactical errors will also make you question the character's limited personality, let alone his sanity. After all, what kind of man signs on to work with Alterplex, a megalithic, mysterious company that promises to draw energy from an alternate Earth in order to power our planet in perpetuity? Doesn't that sound like something a bad guy would promise? Yes, they also promise to take care of Will's family ... should he agree to take on a mission that is never explained in great detail.&nbsp;</p><p>Granted, there are elliptical gaps in our knowledge of what Will has experienced before he wakes up on an alternate Earth. Many of these gaps are filled by flashbacks that slow down what little momentum the film has. But let's deal with what we do know: Alterplex is represented by Abigail (Berenice Marlohe), a chilly company shill who withholds whatever information she must ... until she winds up stuck in the line of fire with Will. Will wakes up on what he surmises is an alternate Earth. He is immediately attacked by giant Alterplex drones and friendly colleague Michael (<a href=#>Tygo Gernandt</a>), now an anti-Alterplex freedom fighter. Will, armed only with a glowing black box that everybody seems to want, must travel back to Alterplex's main structure. Along the way, he dodges the above-mentioned flying killer robots, plus giant airplanes, freighters, and other ships that haphazardly fall from the sky.</p><p>It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Will is working for bad people. Which is a shame, because apparently Will is not that smart. His struggle to make sense of how he could have been betrayed is laughably silly. It also doesn't reveal much about the world we live in. Will's ignorance and selfish desire to protect his own family above everyone else really doesn't say much about him. The whole point of this story is to realize that you can do the wrong thing for the right reasons simply by assuming you are being altruistic when in fact you are making other people's problems all about you.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46koKWkXajEqsDCoWRraGFs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
