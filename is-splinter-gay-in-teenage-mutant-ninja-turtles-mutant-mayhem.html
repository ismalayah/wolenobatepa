As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bounding Into Comics</a> reports, Price of Reason wrote this about the new Splinter in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</strong></a>: “To add insult to injury, at the end of the movie Splinter is seen making out with Scumbug and then professing his love for Scumbug who he seemingly enters into a relationship with.” This was written after the author likewise bashes Rogen’s portrayal of the Turtles.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>Price of Reason continues to explain their reasoning for going against the notion of Splinter being gay, a topic that is now trending all over the internet, specifically on Twitter.</p><p>“Now that in and of itself is already out of character for Splinter as we’ve known him for years as it just doesn’t seem like something he would do. But then later after researching the character posters for this movie and also consulting with Tom from Midnight’s Edge, I’ve come to the conclusion that they’ve decided to present Splinter in this movie as an LGBT character, a creative decision that I disagree with since he’s never been presented that way in the 40 years that this franchise has existed.”</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>But is it true? Twitter certainly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seems convinced</a>, thanks to YouTuber Keemstar, but new evidence has suggested that Splinter’s homosexuality is nothing more than a mere marketing mistake. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmic Book News</a> writes a contradicting report that confirms the question was posed to Reddit, where one user denied the claims, thereafter offering an explanation on the matter.</p><p>“There’s a scene with splitter and scumbug. No voice actor. Promo pic says “scumbug as himself” but I thought the movie portrayed them as female. Leather head and wingnut are female in the movie. I maybe wrong on assuming they were female, but I thought it was a funny scene.”</p><p data-characters=232 data-current-count=232 data-injectable=false>Director Jeff Rowe <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually spoke out</a> on the trending topic to clear the air, confirming that Scumbug was always a female cockroach, and the marketing team made a mistake about the “Scumbug as Himself” poster (pictured below):</p><p>“That was a marketing mistake, and we were furious about it. They put that out, I don’t know who did that or how that happened, but we were immediately like, ‘That’s not true. Don’t put that in the world,’ and that will now be on the internet forever. But that was never the intention. That was never the character. We always imagined her to be a female cockroach. And that one poster was a slip up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scumbug-poster-tmnt.jpg><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>Scumbug is originally male in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comic series, but the character’s gender was changed for the Rowe/Rogen collaboration. Considering that the TMNT fans lost their minds over the creators racebending April O’Neill, it could have been a slight exaggeration by a viewer that led to the start of these rumors.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>Not that it would matter all that much if Splinter was gay, but we know how the internet feels about “woke” content nowadays.</p><p data-characters=94 data-current-count=233 data-injectable=false>Read <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our review</a> of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, currently showing in theaters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlo6W5qrrTnqlmn5Gueqq6jK2cnqaRnLJuudStmKesXaO2r7bAZquuqqShsrR5zK6rmqakYrqixceepGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
