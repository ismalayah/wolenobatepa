I associated, like society taught me, that theater was for gays, and it was for sissies, and things like that. Things that you were taught to be ashamed of."</p><p>"It was 1988 when I came out," Hayes, <a href=#>who recently faced a health scare</a>, continued. "It's so clich√© that it was during Thanksgiving weekend. My mom said I needed to go see a therapist. She wrote me a 10-page letter, both sides on legal pad size paper. 'This is not what God....' You know, the whole uneducated view of it."</p><p>Thankfully, she eventually began to accept her son for who he is.&nbsp;"She became educated and had friends who [were] gay people," he went on. "She was like, 'Oh I see. You're just like me,' and all that. It became fine and wonderful, and then she became so supportive and awesome."</p><p>Nowadays, Hayes,&nbsp;<a href=#>who married composer Scott Icenogle in 2014</a>, couldn't be happier that Will & Grace&nbsp;was<a href=#>&nbsp;revived</a>&nbsp;after 11 years off the air in 2017. As he explained, the hit NBC sitcom, which received <a href=#>a Golden Globe nomination for Best Television Comedy</a>, can once again be used as a reference point by LGBTQ youth when coming out.</p><p>"If you don't have the words to explain it to your family, you can say, 'Like&nbsp;Will & Grace,' or 'Like&nbsp;Ellen DeGeneres,' or whosever out in a public," Hayes said.&nbsp;"There's so many more examples now to help people and give them tools to communicate to kids and their families that being gay is as normal as being straight. There's no difference."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhkaH9ye9KemKdlmJbGpr%2BMqKeepqNivaK1zZ%2BspWWTpLqqusZmnLGolae2prrCnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
