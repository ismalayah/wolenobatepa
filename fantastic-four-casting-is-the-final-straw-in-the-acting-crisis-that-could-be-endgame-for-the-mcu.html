Adam Driver, Margot Robbie, and Paul Mescal were all once rumored to be very close to reaching a deal with Kevin Feige and Co. to enlist in the project. A group that seems wildly out of place and ambitious within the current context and image of the superhero genre, but which would have made perfect sense not five short years ago.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>The updated roster will still include man of the hour Pedro Pascal, Emmy winner Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Oscar nominee Vanessa Kirby, and Stranger Things break-out star Joseph Quinn, but could the reason for the delayed confirmation be down to Marvel’s increased difficulty in getting names like these to say “Yes”?</p><h2 id=h-has-marvel-lost-its-appeal-to-hollywood-s-acting-pool data-injectable=false>Has Marvel lost its appeal to Hollywood’s acting pool?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/The-Avengers-2012.jpg><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>Paul Mescal, Timothée Chalamet, Jacob Elordi, Jeremy Allen White, Zendaya. What do all these actors have in common? Besides being five of the most in-demand young talents of this generation, they’ve also pretty much dismissed the idea of playing a superhero.</p><p data-characters=797 data-current-count=1064 data-injectable=true>A genre that could once pull the likes of Edward Norton, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson,</a> Jennifer Lawrence, and Mark Ruffalo is slowly but surely losing the appeal for younger stars who no longer see the comic book movie world as a chance to bring a popular culture icon to life, but rather as a ball and chain. The necessity to turn every superhero property into a sprawling franchise that would tie them down for years, the CGI-heavy production that places actors in a sea of green screens performing against tennis balls, and the generally bad reputation the genre has gained within more prestigious circles have contributed to the flameout of an industry that was once synonymous with turning a relatively known actor into a globally famous screen legend.</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>“No hard drugs and no superhero movies” was the career advice Leonardo DiCaprio reportedly gave Chalamet, which has apparently become a widespread motto among his contemporaries. Zendaya, who is, famously, Tom Holland’s other half in Marvel’s Spider-Man series, is happy to sit on the sidelines and watch from afar. “If there’s anything I’ve learned from [being a part of the MCU], it’s I don’t think I want that. Being a superhero is not all that it’s cracked up to be,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> in 2021.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Mescal said he wouldn’t “have the patience required,” despite being the lead in another massive-scale production like Gladiator 2, and Allen White has copped to flubbing a Marvel audition because he assumed the studio wanted him more than he wanted them. Elordi, meanwhile, said a quick no to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the new Superman.</a> “That was immediately, ‘No, thank you.’ That’s too much. That’s too dark for me,” he confessed to <a href=#>GQ</a>, adding “I like to make what I would watch.”</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>Just recently, Marvel lost two high-profile, highly qualified actors, Ayo Edebiri and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steven Yeun,</a> both of whom exited Thunderbolts due to scheduling issues, because they would rather pass on the juggernaut than give up their chance to join smaller, more meaningful projects. Despite not having box office success or mainstream exposure as guarantees, these actors prefer the opportunities to flex their acting muscles and gain recognition from respected peers.</p><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=false>The good news is that while Marvel has always leaned on star power to drive people to theater seats, it has also balanced that out with the promise of new, untapped talent like Tom Holland, Iman Vellani, or even Chris Hemsworth. The tide is definitely changing as regards superhero movies’ ranking on the cultural “cool meter,” but these entertainment giants could use that to their advantage by hiring fresh faces. Newer would-be movie stars might still want to please <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DiCaprio, Scorsese, and Tarantino</a>, ideally, but could they really say “No” to debuting on a stage like that?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedlr%2B3sctonZqmpJbAtbXCZp2oraJisKK%2F06KloGWZqHq1tMRmnaKmkaF6tMDRmq5moZ5iwamxjJqaraGenHqkvsisoKxlpJ2utXnCqKylnF2Xsm6xzZ2emqWVYrOwvoytn55lnZjCcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
