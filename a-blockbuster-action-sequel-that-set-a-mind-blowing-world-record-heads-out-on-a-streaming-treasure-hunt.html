That’s 15 jobs on one film, which is insane.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Netflix viewers are recognizing Chan’s hard work, too, after Chinese Zodiac exploded out of nowhere to become one of the Top 10 titles in multiple countries around the world on the streamer’s charts, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>.
