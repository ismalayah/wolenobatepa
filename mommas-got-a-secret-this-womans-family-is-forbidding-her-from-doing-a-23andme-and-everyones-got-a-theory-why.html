But, to stretch this belabored analogy even further, you know what also happens when you climb a tree? Sometimes you fall out of it.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a></strong> user goofywitch666 got folks talking when she revealed her family’s alarming reactions to finding out she wanted to take a 23andMe test. The TikToker explained that, while her dad was very laidback about the situation and felt she should do it if she wanted to, her mother and her grandfather (her mother’s father) were dead against it. Even though the pair of them have done 23andMe tests of their own!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@goofywitch666 href=#>@goofywitch666</a><p>Idek what the implications of this could be because dads chill with it but mom isnt??? hello??? grandpa wa suddenly not okay with me doing it? HELLO</p><a title="♬ original sound - ❤️🇵🇸 🖤" href=#>♬ original sound – ❤️🇵🇸 🖤</a></figure><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>“My grandfather originally bought me a test kit but then suddenly changed his tune,” explains goofywitch666, in a hilarious deadpan delivery that’s laced with equal parts mirth and concern. “Suddenly it was all ‘the government could take your DNA and plant it at a crime scene…’ What the f*** are you talking about?”</p><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Naturally, now the entirety of the app is engrossed in this family drama in the making, with everyone waiting on the edge of their seats for a much-needed update once the test is taken and the results come back. In the meantime, it seems the whole internet has their own pet theory on what the big family secret at threat of coming out could be. “Algorithm bring me back when she finds out who her real dad is,” quipped one. “Options: dad isn’t dad, Grandpa IS dad, or gramps killed 3 people in 1983,” theorized another.</p><p data-characters=611 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>Others spoke from experience. “Ooooh the secrets that were spilled when my sister didn’t turn up on any of our DNA matches,” shared a different commenter. Some think the dad isn’t as innocent as he seems: “Mommas got a secret and pappy is IN ON IT.” As it is, goofywitch666 is convinced we can rule out the “dad’s not her dad” theory, thanks to their close physical resemblance. “See that’s the thing,” she commented. “I look exactly like him. I got his eyes, his smile, even his teeth??? I look exactly like HIS grandma to a t???”</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>The good news for the goofywitch clan is that maybe their skeletons will remain in the closet even if the TikToker does take the test. Although both 23andMe and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AncestryDNA</a> boast 99.9% accuracy rates, mistakes do happen. As MyHeritage’s chief science officer Yanic Erlich told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vox</a>, “We’re talking about 99.9 percent accuracy for these arrays. But even with that high level of accuracy, when you process 1 million places in the genome, you might get 1,000 errors.”</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Then there was that time that a DNA testing company failed to realize that the genetic sample they studied <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">came from a dog, not a person</a>. So if goofywitch666’s test comes back and claims that her biological father is the family pet then we may know what’s happened.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8rrvMppisZZekwW6tjKycnKqVqXq1tMisZLCnnZa7tHnFmqSipKlitrR5xaipm6GUmbavs4yhnKtllqe8rnnDqKCnn12WenN%2FwKebpp1dlrulecSvnKuxn6OytHnGqKtmmV2ptaa70bJksKCpZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
