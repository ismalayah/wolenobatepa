I was the victim but somehow I felt in the wrong.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “We never stayed at my parents’ friends’ house again but we also didn’t talk about what I had said.”</p><p class=p1>Simpson later confronted her alleged attacker, revealing that she eventually forgave them.</p><p class=p1>“I would say about eight years ago I confronted her,” the&nbsp;<i>Newlyweds&nbsp;</i>alum <a href=#>said during a July 2020 appearance on the “Gift of Forgiveness” podcast</a>. “I went to her and I just said, ‘I know you know what was going on and I know that you were being abused,’ ‘cause she was being abused by an older guy. And basically, and he was always there at the house as well — he never touched me, but he would abuse her and then she would come to me and do the stuff to me — and so in so many ways I felt bad for her and I was allowing the abuse to happen.”</p><p class=p1>Former Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>Clare Crawley</strong></a> has <a href=#>also been candid about surviving abuse</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I grew up going to a Catholic school and I was the victim of a predator,” the California-based hairstylist<a href=#> revealed during a September 2021 appearance on&nbsp;<i>Red Table Talk: The Estefans</i></a>. “My parents looked at Catholic priests as — they held them on a pedestal.”</p><p class=p1>Crawley, who briefly served as the season 16 lead of&nbsp;<a href=#><i>The Bachelorette</i></a>,&nbsp;added: “My parents did the best they could and reached out for the resources they could at the time and sent me to this priest. I don’t think there was any counseling that was done. It was a one-on-one time to be a predator.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down to read the accounts of famous survivors such as <strong><a href=#>Tyra Banks</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a></strong> and <a href=#><strong>Mary J.
