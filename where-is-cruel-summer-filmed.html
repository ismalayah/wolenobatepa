Like its predecessor, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season two of the series</a> features grounded, beautiful locations that help the show to feel real, and its setting properly lived in. Neither season takes place in a real location, instead leaning on areas like season one’s fictional Skylin, Texas, but the backgrounds featured across both of the show’s seasons are very much real.</p><h2 id=h-cruel-summer-s-filming-locations data-injectable=false>Cruel Summer‘s filming locations</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Unlike most popular series, Cruel Summer‘s first two seasons <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t appear to be directly connected</a>. While season two has yet to reveal all of its secrets, it seems to be entirely removed from the events of season one. With this in mind, each season sports entirely different casts, storylines, and filming locations.</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>The first season, which follows Olivia Holt’s Kate Wallis alongside Chiara Aurelia’s Jeanette Turner, Froy Gutierrez’s Jamie Henson, and Blake Lee’s Martin Harris, is fittingly filmed in Texas, where its fictional town is located. Skylin, Texas is fully fictional, but all those Dallas backdrops are the real deal. The first season was filmed over the course of around six months in the bustling city, providing the perfect Texas feel for each of its 10 episodes.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=false>Season two takes place in an entirely new town, this one relying heavily on its proximity to open water. It was filmed over a much shorter length of time — right around four months — in the coastal city of Richmond, British Columbia. Fans of the series can peruse familiar sights for themselves by visiting either city for a sightseeing tour, and look forward to more season two episode drops soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGaho2Kws8HEpWSsrZ2isrN5xaKjpp2UZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
