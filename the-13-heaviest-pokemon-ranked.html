Giratina (Altered Forme) – 1653.5 lbs / 750.0 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Giratina.jpg><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>With the release of&nbsp;Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, Giratina appeared for the first time in the fourth generation of games. Although Giratina’s Altered Forme is listed at the bottom of the list of the heaviest Pokemon, you wouldn’t be able to call it lightweight; in fact, for a comparison that is a bit off the scale, it weighs 1653.3 lbs more than Gastly.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>As a Ghost/Dragon-type Pokemon, Giratina comes in both its Origin and Altered Form forms. It is lighter in its Origin Forme, in which Giratina loses its legs and becomes more like a sinister snake, but it is taller with its elongated tail. While Giratina’s Origin Form is much more menacing than its Altered Form, the Altered Form remains much heavier and, therefore, much more dangerous, with its heightened menacing appearance.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Giratina’s so-called “Altered Forme” is the mode that was introduced first in&nbsp;<a href=#>Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a>; its separate Origin Forme was introduced in&nbsp;Pokémon Platinum. According to the stats, Altered is more defensive, while Origin is more offensive, but both of them share the same 680-point base stat total.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-12-melmetal-1763-7-lbs-800-0-kg data-injectable=false>12. Melmetal – 1763.7 lbs / 800.0 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Melmetal.jpg><p data-characters=675 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Next up is the creature&nbsp;known as the Hex Nut Pokémon, Melmetal. In&nbsp;Pokémon: Let’s Go Pikachu&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pokémon: Let’s Go Eevee, Melmetal was introduced as a fierce Mythical Pokémon that was incredibly powerful in both games. However, he had a terrible speed. In addition to being armed as a solid defensive type, he also has the signature Double Iron Bash attack, which hits twice and can cause flinch. As Melmetal weighs in at 1763 lbs. (800 kg), it is the only Mythical Pokémon on our list. Where other Pokémon like Celebi or Mew are quite light, Melmetal is quite heavy, which makes sense since it is a massive golem made from liquid metal.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>When one considers that this Pokémon’s body is composed almost exclusively of mercury, it should not come as a surprise to anybody who knows anything about the periodic table that its weight would be so high. As a matter of fact, considering that a liter of mercury weighs in at around 1400 kg, this big guy should probably weigh as much as that, if not more.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>It is likely that the golem’s weight is limited by its height as it stands at only 8 feet, meaning it is far from the mythical metal giant you may have been expecting. However, Melmetal does live up to its reputation with its Gigantamax form, which measures the length of a building.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-11-stakataka-1807-8-lbs-820-0-kg data-injectable=false>11. Stakataka – 1807.8 lbs / 820.0 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Stakataka.jpg><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>The Ultra Beasts that were introduced in Generation 7 are creatures from another world who wandered into Alola by accident, and Stakataka is one of the least organic-looking Ultra Beasts in the group. Introduced in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, this Rock/Steel-type Pokémon is a tank when it comes to combat. It makes perfect sense from its name alone that this Pokémon would weigh nearly two tons because it’s made up of a stack of mystical bricks.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>A dominant Pokémon that is a towering 18-foot tall structure at a glance, Stakataka is one of the more obvious heavy Pokémon in the game, but it is only 200 pounds heavier than a horse.</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>Even though Stakataka is an Ultra Beast, it isn’t what it appears at first glance to be. The mysterious stack of four-legged blocks known as the Rampart Pokémon is actually a combination of many smaller life forms, all of which are characterized by having a notoriously shiny “eye.” Considering that the Ultra Beasts are alien creatures, it’s safe to guess that they are not quite stone and, therefore, can be much lighter in weight than a stone tower of that size.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>10. Dialga (Origin Forme) – 1871 lbs / 848.7 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Dialga-Origin-Forme.jpg><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Weighing in among the lightest on our list is the Temporal Legendary Pokémon first introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl. However, Dialga by itself is not part of this list, weighing in at 1505.8 lbs / 683kg while it is in its base form.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>But when you use the Adamant Crystal in-game, you can transform the Pokémon into its Origin Forme, which increases its weight, changes its appearance, and changes its statistics. While in its Origin Forme Dialga weighs in at 1871 lbs / 848.7 kg.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>Dialga was the mascot for Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond, appearing on their box art and on their start-up screens. Dialga wields the power of time and can create its own dimension. These powers probably have something to do with why the Legendary Pokémon is so heavy. Dialga is a Dragon-type and Steel-type Pokémon, and he is #483 on the National Pokédex.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Guzzlord – 1957.7 lbs / 888 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Guzzlord.jpg><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=635 data-injectable=true>This Dark-type and Dragon-Type Pokémon is #799 on the National Pokédex, and it is the ninth heaviest Pokémon on this list, weighing in at 1957.7 lbs / 888 kg. Guzzlord was introduced in Generation VII with Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon. It is one of the Alolan Ultra Beasts and is not the only Ultra Beast to be on this list.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Living up to its name, Guzzlord’s in-game description references the fact that it is always eating, and it has apparently eaten buildings and mountains, so no wonder Guzzlord is one of the heaviest Pokémon of all time. Guzzlord also holds the title of heaviest Dark-type Pokémon.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. Mudsdale – 2028.3 lbs / 920 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Mudsdale.jpg><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Mudsdale, like Guzzlord, was also introduced in Generation VII with Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon. #750 on the National Pokédex, Mudsdale takes the eighth spot on this list, weighing in at 2028.3 lbs / 920 kg. It is a Ground-type Pokémon that resembles a horse, and it evolves from Mudbray starting at level thirty.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Mudsdales are not just heavy for a horse either, it is tall as well, at 8’02” / 2.5 m. Canonically, parts of a Mudsdale are covered in wet and hardened mud, which would account for the immense weight of the Pokémon.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Mega Metagross – 2078.7 lbs / 942.9 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Mega-Metagross.jpg><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>Seventh on this list is Metagross, but not just any plain Metagross, Mega Metagross. The regular version of Metagross weighs in at 1212.5 lbs. / 550 kg, whereas the Mega Metagross weighs in at a stellar 2078.7 lbs. / 942. 9 kg, almost doubling in weight.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>Metagross has always been known as one of the most powerful Pokémon, especially for one that is not a Legendary type. Metagross was introduced in Generation III, in Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire.</p><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>Metagross is #376 on the National Pokédex, and it is the final form of Beldum, evolving from Metang starting from level forty-five. It is a Steel-type and Psychic-type known in the Pokédex as the Iron Leg Pokémon. When Metagross Mega Evolves into Mega Metagross – by using a Mega Stone – its form is achieved by linking itself, a Metang, and two Beldum together, creating a behemoth of a Pokémon. Out of every Mega Evolution, Mega Metagross is the heaviest.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Groudon – 2094.4 lbs / 950 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Groudon.jpg><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Groudon was also introduced in Generation III, appearing in Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Sapphire. The Ground-type Legendary Pokémon weighs in at 2094.4 lbs. / 950 kg and is the sixth heaviest Pokémon on this list. Groudon was the mascot Pokémon of Pokémon Ruby, appearing on its box art and on its start-up screen.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=165 data-injectable=false>Groudon, along with the other member of its Legendary duo Kyogre and the third latecomer Rayquaza, is a sort of prehistoric Pokémon dubbed a super-ancient Pokémon.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>The Legendary Pokémon is #383 on the National Pokédex and has no evolutions. Groudon is designed to look like a dinosaur, with his skin being as hard and tough as metal, adding to his weight. This is not even the heaviest that Groudon can get, but more on that later.</p><p data-characters=89 data-current-count=89 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;The Best Pokémon Games Of All Time – Ranked</a>&nbsp;on Attack of the Fanboy</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Eternatus – 2094.4 lbs / 950 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Eternamax-Eternatus.jpg><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Eternatus is the fifth heaviest Pokémon on this list and is tied with Groudon, but edges it out on a technicality. The Legendary Pokémon was introduced in Generation VIII in Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield. It holds #890 on the National Pokédex and is a Poison-type and a Dragon-type. When in its basic form, Eternatus weighs 2094.4 lbs / 950 kg.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>When in its base form, it is the heaviest of all the Dragon-type Pokémon and of all the Poison-types. It is also the tallest Pokémon overall, measuring 65’07” / 20 m tall.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>The reason this Pokémon comes in before Groudon is a slight cheat: it has another form, the Eternamax Eternatus, but this form cannot be caught. The weight of this form is unknown but as it is 380’01” / 100 m tall, the form surely weighs much more than the original. But because this form of Pokémon cannot be caught, it does not warrant its own entry.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Primal Groudon – 2204 lbs / 999.7 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Primal-Groudon.jpg><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>You have read that right: Groudon has made the list a second time, only this time it is Groudon in its Primal form. Primal Groudon weighs a little more than Groudon and weighs 2204 lbs / 999.7 kg, coming in at number four. There are not many differences between Groudon and Primal Groudon, although Primal Groudon is the mascot for Pokémon Omega Ruby — the remake of Pokémon Ruby.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>When transforming into Primal Groudon by holding the Red Orb, it becomes a Fire-type Pokémon in addition to a Ground-type Pokémon. Primal Groudon is, therefore, the heaviest Fire-type Pokémon as well as the heaviest Ground-type Pokémon.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Cosmoem – 2204.4 lbs / 999.9 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Cosmoem.jpg><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>One of the more interesting Pokémon on this list, Cosmoem is a Legendary Psychic-type Pokémon that is the third heaviest Pokémon. Cosmoem was introduced in Generation VII in the games Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon. At level fifty-three, it evolves into either Solgaleo or Lunala, depending on the game, but no matter the game, it will evolve from Cosmog when you reach level forty-three.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=841 data-injectable=true>Even though Cosmoem is half the size of Cosmog, measuring 0’04” / 0.1 m, Cosmoem holds the record for the highest weight increase from its evolution, as Cosmog weighs only 0.2 lbs., while Cosmoem weighs a massive 2204.4 lbs / 999.9 kg. Cosmoem is also the smallest and the heaviest Psychic-type Pokémon. It is #790 on the National Pokédex and has a spatial design, in fact, its weight and size are most likely a reference to a black hole.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Celesteela – 2204.4 lbs / 999.9 kg&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Celesteela.jpg><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true>Celesteela is tied with Cosemoem, weighing the same amount, 2204.4 lbs / 999.9 kg. However, we’ve put it at number two because, unlike Cosmoem, it is not a Legendary Pokémon. Celesteela is a Steel-type and Flying-type Pokémon that was introduced in Generation VII in the games Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon, like Cosmoem. Like Guzzlord, Celesteela is also an Ultra Beast.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>Celesteela is #797 on the National Pokédex and — discounting the alternate forms of some other Pokémon — it is the heaviest Steel-type and Flying-type Pokémon.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>Celesteela’s weight can be accounted for by what it is made out of. Its metallic body stores energy, which can be used to send the Pokémon into space, much like a space shuttle. Celesteela has no evolutions, prior or otherwise.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-1-copperajah-with-the-heavy-metal-ability-2866-lbs-1300-kg data-injectable=false>1. Copperajah (with the Heavy Metal ability) – 2866 lbs / 1300 kg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Pokemon-Copperajah.jpg><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=831 data-injectable=true>The heaviest Pokémon on this list is the heaviest Pokémon only by a technicality. Copperajah ordinarily weighs less than all the other Pokémon on this list at 1433 lbs / 650 kg; however, with its Hidden Ability, Heavy Metal, the Pokémon weighs a spectacular 2866 lbs / 1300 kg, which is much heavier than both Cosmoem and Copperajah. Copperajah is a Steel-type Pokémon and is, therefore, the heaviest Steel-type, if counting its Hidden Ability. Heavy Metal doubles the weight of whichever Pokémon possesses the ability.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Copperajah can be evolved from Cufant at level thirty-four, and it is #879 on the National Pokédex. The Pokémon was first introduced in Generation VIII in Pokémon Shield and Pokémon Sword. Cooperajah looks like it was based on an Indian elephant. While the Pokémon resembles an elephant, which is quite heavy, the copper mixed in with its skin undoubtedly adds to its weight.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=false>Some of these Pokémon are among the <a href=#>most iconic</a> of the entire franchise. It helps that some of the Pokémon on this list are also among the most powerful and, in some cases, the most beloved of all time. One thing is for sure, <a href=#>Ash Ketchum</a> should not be able to pick any of these Pokémon up (even though Pokémon might show us otherwise).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoq6GdXWaAbrTEmq2inaOperG7yp6kqKZdp66vt8SdZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
