Wit produced a number of these episodes for Attack on Titan when the first season originally came out, with two separate storylines that broke down some of our favorite characters, one detailing the life of Captain Levi before joining the Survey Corps, and another involving a case Annie Leonhart worked on when she became a member of the Military Police.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>Now, after all these years, the OVA episodes are finally getting the dub treatment, with the first one expected to arrive on May 8 and the rest following suit on a weekly basis according to what the anime streamer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has recently announced</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FPbhC_BagAE-Hee.jpg><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>Ilseâ€™s Notebook involves Hange arriving at the scene of a scouting mission and learning more about the nature of the titans through the notebook of one of their fallen comrades.
