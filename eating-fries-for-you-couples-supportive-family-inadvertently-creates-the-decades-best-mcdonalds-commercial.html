When the one thing you want is so far out of reach, it‚Äôs not hard for people to sometimes turn to the most unlikely sources of hope. For those outside the in vitro fertilization community, though, choosing <strong>McDonald‚Äôs</strong> fries as a beacon of hope may seem a little odd.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>TikTok user <strong>@ttcbabyblack</strong> posted a video showcasing her and her husband getting McDonald‚Äôs fries after an IVF transfer, claiming the purchase was good luck. Sharing the photo on Facebook, Brittney saw an outpouring of support from her friends and family by them also purchasing fries from Mickey D‚Äôs, as well as a few other restaurants. Even Brittney‚Äôs mother made fries at home to show her support for her daughter‚Äôs journey.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@ttcbabyblack href=#>@ttcbabyblack</a><p>We are greatful for all the love, support & prayers. ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è <a title=ivftransfer href=#>#ivftransfer</a> <a title=ivffries href=#>#ivffries</a> <a title=ivftransfer href=#>#ivftransfer</a> <a title=infertilityjourney href=#>#infertilityjourney</a> <a title=ivfjourney href=#>#ivfjourney</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Dandelions (slowed + reverb) - Ruth B. & sped up + slowed" href=#>‚ô¨ Dandelions (slowed + reverb) ‚Äì Ruth B. & sped up + slowed</a></figure><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>The comments section was full of joyful sobs over how supportive Brittney‚Äôs friends and family are in her infertility journey. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm crying over French fries.‚Äù one commenter said. Another recognized the support Brittney has, saying, ‚ÄúYou truly have a village.‚Äù Some are even rallying behind Brittney and her husband. ‚ÄúGetting some fries for u tomorrow! Best of luck &lt;3.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>So why are French fries a good luck charm for IVF patients? While it‚Äôs unclear exactly where the luckiness of the fries came from, many believe it came from advice for IVF patients at high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). OHSS is a disorder caused by excessive hormones in the reproductive system, such as those given during IVF treatments. Many patients at risk for OHSS are told by their doctors that after an IVF transfer, they should eat a high-sodium and high-protein diet to lower their risk of experiencing OHSS.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/McD-Fries.jpg><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=798 data-injectable=true>Not every person going through IVF is at risk for experiencing OHSS, so it‚Äôs unclear why the community as a whole is attached to the idea of eating sodium after a treatment. But regardless, if you go into any online forum dedicated to couples going through IVF treatment, you‚Äôll see countless mentions of post-treatment fries. Mcdonald‚Äôs is the most common post-treatment treat, but you‚Äôll still see your fair share of Chick-Fil-A, Arby‚Äôs, and In-N-Out Burger as well.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>Whether or not fries have any actual medical benefits for IVF patients, this food trend is far from dying out. Plus, it‚Äôs a great way to not only get a bit of luck during a difficult time but allow friends and family to show their support uniquely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8pq3ToqWgZZantqa%2FjJ%2Bmq2WppMJur86up6Wdo2LAtrzPqKmtoaaaeqetzKKjsmWZo66lwsSrq56mpKHGbq%2FRnpitnaNiwamxjJ2cnJmUmsBursSsq2alk5m8r63Lnapmm5%2Biuqa%2BwqKYpWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
