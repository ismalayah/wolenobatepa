Rip and Beth Captain with his latest Instagram post. Move over, Ferdinand Magellan; we’ve got a new, most famous admiral in our sights! Hauser’s adoration for his on-screen partner has never been a well-kept secret, and for a good reason. Hauser and Kelly Reilly are living out an intense and emotionally-charged storyline in the Taylor Sheridan drama, and their romance is something that draws viewers into the series.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">love they share on-screen </a>is only enhanced by the compassion and high regard they hold each other within when the cameras aren’t rolling. Both Hauser and Reilly have real-life love interests, but they’ve become intricately linked because of Sheridan’s Yellowverse, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their bond</a> is quite precious. In fact, they have shared Instagram photos in adoration of their spirit and connection within the series, and Hauser’s latest post looks like something out of a fairytale.</p><p data-characters=39 data-current-count=39 data-injectable=false>Seriously, how dreamy is this picture?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Cole Hauser (@colehauser22)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>The caption for the photo is equally as phenomenal, as Hauser points out the importance of becoming what you want to see most of in this world and leading with the kind of circumstances you hope to come back to you.</p><p>“Attract what you expect, reflect what you desire, become what you respect, mirror what you admire. Enjoy!”</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>While Rip and Beth have been up against quite painful events in their lives, both past and present, they’ve found a vulnerability and openness in the space they hold for one another. It’s a romantic notion — that someone could see all of our broken pieces and love us nonetheless. That’s what Beth and Rip offer to one another, a love that overcomes, a safe space to exist when things hurt and are too hard to face.</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>As the seasons have progressed, fans have seen the love between Rip and Beth grow in monumental ways; they’ve taken steps forward and backward, together and apart — yet somehow, their paths lead them back to one another every time.
