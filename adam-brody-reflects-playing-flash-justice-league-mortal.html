Heck, I remember when I vehemently kept up with all news pertaining to the film’s production more than a decade ago – only to feel heartbroken when it was cancelled.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>In recent years, more trivia regarding the ill-fated movie that would’ve been directed by George Miller has come to light, be it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">concept art showing off Batman and Superman</a>, or even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">whispers of a brutal battle involving Superman and Wonder Woman</a>.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Now, it’s Adam Brody who’s reflecting on his big time role that never truly came to fruition: the Flash. That’s right, he was set to suit up as the Scarlet Speedster before the studio pulled the plug. While speaking with Yahoo, the actor couldn’t help expressing regret, saying:</p><p>“In hindsight, I should’ve been more bummed [at the time]. I really liked it. But I just kind of felt like, ‘No big deal. The next thing will come.’ And it kind of did, but it kind of didn’t. But nothing like that came along again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jlm-lineup-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jlm-superman.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jlm-batman.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dj-cotrona-superman.jpg><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>Like most folks involved with the production, Brody had good things to say about the screenplay, adding:</p><p>“The script was really good.&nbsp;It’s not that it was revolutionary, and I’m pretty objective about this kind of thing, and I think I have a pretty good gauge of scripts. I thought the casting was right. Not just me, but everyone, tonally, was going to fit right.”</p><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=false>Although a timeline wherein <strong>Justice League Mortal</strong> made it to screen ultimately meant never seeing Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman or Jason Momoa as Aquaman, it’s fun to ponder what might have been. Yes, I did think the Justice League movie we got in 2017 was fun to watch, but it wasn’t quite what I’d hoped for. Miller’s vision, however, sounded like a grand slam. Plus, one has to wonder how differently the Marvel/DC rivalry would’ve unfolded if the first major superhero team-up picture arrived in 2009, as opposed to The Avengers in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomJ2ZnWKvs7vDsmSrnZahsqTA0manpZmpnruoecWlmKygXZ%2FCtMDInJxmpJWWtLaxjKamq6yRoXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
