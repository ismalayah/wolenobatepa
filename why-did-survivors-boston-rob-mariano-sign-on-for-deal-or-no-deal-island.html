But, this time, he’s living the island life as part of another franchise —<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deal or No Deal Island</a>.</strong> Boston Rob has played Survivor five times with his third venture, season 22’s Redemption Island, being a winning effort. He and his wife, Amber Mariano, also competed in seasons 7 and 11 of The Amazing Race. We last saw him compete during Survivor Winners at War in 2020, and his last race around the world aired in 2007. So, it’s been a minute since Boston Rob played in Survivor, and it’s closing in on two decades since he tried his hands at another franchise.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>So, he joined a crop of reality TV newbies as they took on NBC’s resurrection and overhaul of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deal or No Deal</a>, which is set to premiere on February 26. But, why did Boston Rob choose to be a part of the inaugural season of a brand-new competition show?</p><h2 id=h-boston-rob-rides-again data-injectable=false>Boston Rob rides again</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>We <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">saw with Big Brother legend Dan Gheesling</a> was recently drawn to The Traitors US because it was a new challenge. And it sounds like Boston Rob had the same line of thinking. He spoke about Deal or No Deal Island with his former fellow Survivor castaway Rob Cesternino on the latter’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Has a Podcast</a>.</p><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Boston Rob said that he had been a fan of Deal or No Deal since its inception in the mid-2000s. “That combined with the fact that this is a new show, something that’s never been done before,” he said.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>“We didn’t even know the rules until we got out to the island,” the “Robfather” continued. “So, trying to figure out the strategy for the first time, being a part of the inaugural season, and having the element of chance and luck combined with strategy and competition on a tropical island somewhere. It just kind of rang true to me, and I said you know what, this is something I want to be a part of.”</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Boston Rob was asked if another reason he joined the cast was knowing he’d play against a field of rookie reality competitors. He admitted that it was a thought in his mind — that he’d have a major experience advantage. But, he also pointed to the fact that he’s a famous Survivor threat, which instantly put a target on his back.</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=835 data-injectable=true>Still, the format of the game isn’t like Survivor, and Boston Rob said a group of contestants couldn’t team up and vote him out, like what happened three times in the past. “This is not Survivor,” Boston Rob said. “So, it’s not like an alliance where they can gang up and vote me out. That’s not a part of this show. So, to be a part of something where potentially I can control my own destiny, and I have a shot, it’s appealing.”</p><p data-characters=171 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>Boston Rob also brought up his age – 48 – and said that he was the “old guy on the show,” which may have helped minimize his threat level as well.</p><h2 id=h-will-boston-rob-continue-appearing-in-reality-competition-shows data-injectable=false>Will Boston Rob continue appearing in reality competition shows?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>So, it’s all well and good that Boston Rob will star on Deal or No Deal Island. But, was this a one-and-done thing? With Survivor legends Cirie Fields, Parvati Shallow, Sandra Diaz-Twine, and Stephenie LaGrossa Kendrick all signing on for The Traitors, and notorious Survivor notable Johnny Fairplay recently appearing on House of Villains, there’s no doubt Boston Rob’s manager has been fielding phone calls.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>Well, Rob Cesternino asked Boston Rob if playing Deal or No Deal Island “reignited” his reality competition juices, and he admitted that it did — “a little bit.”</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>“Everybody’s watching The Traitors now,” Boston Rob said. “There’s a lot of past Survivor contestants on it. Sandra was over in Australia doing Survivor Australia before that. I don’t know. I think there’s a little bit of a resurgence of reality competition stuff, and I think it’s entertaining. So, yeah. I’m happy to be off the couch.”</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false>“So, you’re open?” Rob Cesternino followed up.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=171 data-injectable=false>“Hey, you never know, Rob,” he replied. “If it’s the right thing, you know?”</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=false>Rob Cesternino finished the interview by asking him directly about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">House of Villains,</a> and Boston Rob played aloof. It was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed last month</a> that E!’s newest competition property will return for a second season after the success of its opening iteration. And since it’s a cast brimming with reality villains, Boston Rob fits the mold perfectly, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the Robfather’s next stop is the “Villains’ Lair.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmm6KcXajCs8LIr6arq12XvLTAzqdkq6eSYrqivsiapahlo560r3nOp2Sfp6Jisaaty2amq2WepHqlscClZKKrnJa7pXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
