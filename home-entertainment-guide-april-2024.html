The Finnish director of "<a href=#>Le Havre</a>" and "<a href=#>The Other Side of Hope</a>" delivered one of his most acclaimed films in 2023 with the charming "Fallen Leaves," a film that might seem too slight for outsized acclaim but its charm is in that gentle simplicity. Alma Poysti plays Ansa, a single woman in Helsinki who works at a supermarket. She meets a man named Holappa (<a href=#>Jussi Vatanen</a>) who struggles similarly with his job and a lonely life. Somehow completely deadpan while also being deeply heartfelt, "Fallen Leaves" is a sweet, sincere piece of character-driven filmmaking. It has no great moral message beyond appreciating the beauty of ordinary life, in all its unpredictability.</p><p><a href=#>Buy it here</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Special Features<br>Q&A with <a href=#>Alma Pöysti</a> & Jussi Vatanen<br>Trailer<br>An illustrated booklet featuring "The World According to Aki Kaurismäki" and credits</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/66302ea8306fcc0c117438ad/content_Kingdom.jpg><p><strong>"The Kingdom Trilogy"</strong></p><p>Despite some of the problematic things he's said (and arguably done to some of his leading ladies on set given the stories about "Dancer in the Dark"), I do hope Lars von Trier makes another film. Now suffering from Parkinson's Disease, Von Trier has been a visionary and brilliant artist, delivering incredible films like "<a href=#>Melancholia</a>," "<a href=#>Dogville</a>," and "<a href=#>Breaking the Waves</a>," among many others. Even his missteps are fascinating. However, if the final act of "Riget" (or "The Kingdom"), which premiered last year, is his last word, it's a powerful one. (More on how much I love it <a href=#>here</a>.)&nbsp;Mubi has now collected all three chapters of this breakthrough series into one gorgeous box set, complete with commentary and a dense companion booklet.</p><p><a href=#>Buy it here</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Special Features<br>Selected episode commentary by Lars von Trier, <a href=#>Niels Vørsel</a> and Molly Stensgård<br>In Lars von Trier's Kingdom - Documentary<br>Behind the Scenes - Interviews with Lars von Trier and cast<br>TV commercial for the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet - Directed by Lars von Trier<br>The Kingdom Trilogy - A Companion' - 28-page booklet<br>English subtitles</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/66302eb3b8b50d0c0cae6377/content_La_Haine.jpg><p><strong>"La Haine" (Criterion)</strong></p><p>I can vividly remember seeing <a href=#>Mathieu Kassovitz</a>'s "La Haine" in London for the first time almost thirty years ago. It's such a powerful gut punch of a film, a movie that felt like nothing else that was coming out of French cinema at the time (at least not that my 20-year-old eyes had seen). It's also the first time I remember seeing <a href=#>Vincent Cassel</a>, as charismatic as actors come right from such a young age. Kassovitz won Best Director at Cannes for this great film, which has now been given a detailed 4K restoration that was supervised by the D.P. and approved by the director. All the previous special features are available too, including deleted scenes, a commentary, and a 10th anniversary documentary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqGnnZp6prrTnqmtmZmjuqa602aerqGUmnqivNGio2ZqYGeB</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
