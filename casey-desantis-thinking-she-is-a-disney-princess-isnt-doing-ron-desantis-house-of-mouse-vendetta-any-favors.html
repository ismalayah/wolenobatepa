But it seems like she is not done with fanning the flames.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>So, DeSantis chose to attend her husband’s State of the address in a pink flowing off-shoulder gown complete with white satin gloves. Not only was she over-dressed for the event, but she also looked very out of place amid everyone dressed formally. But it’s not the first time when she let her intrusive thoughts win and her latest foray into playing Disney Princess is only a reminder that this is happening while Ron DeSantis relentlessly pursues his mindless agenda to punish Disney for standing up against his unjustified “Don’t Say Gay” bill.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m sorry, but the attire of <a href=#>@CaseyDeSantis</a> is just outright odd.</p><p>Does she think she is British royalty?</p><p>Look at the crowd she’s with and how they are dressed for the same event.</p><p>White gloves???</p><p>Read the room, weirdo. <a href=#>https://t.co/Z9ynGjJazx</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HpnRPflfE2</a></p>— Heidi 🟧 (@HeidiOCanada) <a href=#>May 27, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Commander Meatball and Serena:<br>They’re both socially awkward and do not know how to read the room.
