The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">finer details</a> of the tragedy have become the bedrock of several documentaries including Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal on Netflix and Murdaugh Murders: A Deadly Dynasty on Hulu. The crimes have become a stain on his legacy and the entire Murdaugh dynasty. But they are not the only problems plaguing this now-disgraced lawyer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Alex Murdaugh is also accused of stealing millions of dollars from his clients throughout the years, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>. Here is a man who was a once respected lawyer with enough money to last multiple lifetimes. Today, he’s living out the remainder of his life behind bars without the possibility of parole. This begs the question: how much is Alex Murdaugh worth now?</p><h2 id=h-what-is-alex-murdaugh-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>What is Alex Murdaugh’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Maggie-Paul-and-Alex-Murdaugh-.jpg><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>For a man who’s stolen millions upon millions of dollars from people, it only makes sense that it’d be tough to pin down his exact net worth. Various outlets have reported his net worth around $1 million, all citing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Exact Net Worth</a> as a source.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=703 data-injectable=true>On Sept. 21, Alex Murdaugh officially pled guilty to 22 counts of financial fraud and money laundering. As such, he’ll be required to pay a total of $9 million in restitution fees. According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">South Carolina State Attorney General’s office</a>, he has also been indicted on 99 counts of defrauding victims out of nearly $8.8 million and the state of around $486,819. The trial date for this indictment has not been set as of this writing.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=false>Considering any subsequent liabilities that result from a guilty verdict, the assumption is that the now-barred Alex Murdaugh will take an even greater hit to his net worth. When a more concrete answer is shared, we will provide an update. Then again, with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">life sentence to serve without the possibility of parole</a> and the daily reminder of his murdered wife and son, a negatively impacted net worth should be the least of his worries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZGhsrl5zK6pnZmlnLW0ec2eq2avn6fBqXnIp2RraGJofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
