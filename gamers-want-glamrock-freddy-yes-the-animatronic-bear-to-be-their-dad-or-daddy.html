Through it all, the team is working hard on the next chapter of the FNAF gaming franchise and we are excited to show the fans more and more as we march towards release.”</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Alright, now be honest: Do you think Glamrock Freddy from <strong>Security Breach</strong> is proper dad and/or daddy material?
